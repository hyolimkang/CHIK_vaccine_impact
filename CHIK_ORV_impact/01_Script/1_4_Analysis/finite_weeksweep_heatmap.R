### -----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Publication-quality BRR heatmap: x = vaccination start week,
### y = coverage, fill = BRR (smoothed), faceted by AgeCat x setting --
### mirrors the style of the reference travel-BRR contour figure (blue/white/
### red diverging, dashed BRR=1 contour), rendered from
### brr_weeksweep_summary_finite.RData (finite_weeksweep_brr.R output).
###
### The raw grid is sparse (7 weeks x 4 coverage = 28 points per facet), so a
### 2D tensor-product GAM smooth is fit per facet and predicted onto a fine
### grid for a continuous-looking surface -- the same reason the reference
### figure's underlying grid is almost certainly coarser than its rendered
### resolution. This does NOT re-run any simulation; it only interpolates
### between already-computed BRR values, so read the smoothed surface as a
### visual aid for locating the BRR=1 boundary, not as new evidence between
### grid points.
###
### Colour is STEPPED (binned), not a continuous gradient: a continuous
### diverging fill fades to near-white across a wide band around BRR = 1,
### which washes out exactly the region readers most need to compare against
### the BRR = 1 contour. Discrete bins keep every band visibly distinct.
